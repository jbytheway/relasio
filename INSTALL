This project uses makeshift to build.  If the makeshift directory is empty then
you probably need to run

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Next you will need some dependencies:

- boost (not sure which version exactly).  If your distro splits boost into
  multiple packages you'll need Boost.Filesystem.
- readline, obviously.

You may need to add some things to user.mk, e.g. to get the right g++ version.  Here for example is my user.mk:

  CXX = g++-4.4.1

See makeshift/INSTALL for details of what goes in user.mk.

Then to get a debug version it should be simply

$ make

and you can run the test app with

$ make test

If it all works you can build the release version with

$ make release

This will build inside a directory called release.  But, frankly, this is not a
performance-critical application, so you're probably better off sticking to
debug mode.
